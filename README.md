# InSAR-Permafrost-RTS
# Data-Driven Atmospheric Phase Identification and Removal for Enhanced InSAR Monitoring of Permafrost Thaw Subsidence

This repository contains the Python implementation of the methodologies described in the paper "Data-Driven Atmospheric Phase Identification and Removal for Enhanced InSAR Monitoring of Permafrost Thaw Subsidence". The software is designed to improve the accuracy of InSAR (Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar) data analysis by identifying and removing atmospheric phase components, enhancing the monitoring capabilities for permafrost thaw subsidence.

## Features

- **Atmospheric Phase Identification**: Automatically identifies atmospheric phases in InSAR data using data-driven techniques.
- **Phase Removal**: Implements algorithms to remove the identified atmospheric phase effects, leading to clearer and more accurate InSAR images.
- **Permafrost Monitoring**: Specifically tailored for monitoring permafrost thaw subsidence, crucial for understanding climate change impacts.

## Installation

To install the necessary dependencies, run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
